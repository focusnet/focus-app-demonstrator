# FOCUS mobile application demonstrator

Demonstrator for the LIGNA 2015 fair. Only the minimal requirements for this
event have been implemented.

There are still probably many bugs, but due to the short life time of this 
demonstrator, we didn't put too much effort in finalizing everything. However, 
it is ready to accept other scenarios quite easily. 

## Build process
